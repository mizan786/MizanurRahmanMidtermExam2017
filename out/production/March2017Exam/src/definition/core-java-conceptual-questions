Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Ans: The main components of jdk are archive, compiler, deassembler, debugger and documentation.
java archive is designed to package applets or multiple files into a single archive.
compiler reads the code and compile them to byte code.
java deassembler command prints its output to stdout.
Java Debugger is a command-line debugger for Java classes. It helps us in debugging our Java code
Documentation parses the declarations and documentation comments in the Java source files and produces a corresponding set of HTML pages.
What is IDE?
Ans: It is a software application that helps us to write and debug java programm.
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Ans: Some of the IDEs are aclipse, netBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, BlueJ, jEdit etc.
Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans: When we write code using note pad or aclipse, the compiler converts it to byte code in the fprm of .class. The class file then loads in
the JMV using java loader. JMV then sends all the infomation to OS that shows us the output.
what is class?
Ans: A class is a blueprint or template to describe the behaviors of objects in java.
What is object?
Ans:  An objects is an instance of a class.It has state and behavior.
What is the entry point of an application?
Ans:An entry point of an application is where control is transferred from the operating system to a computer program,
    at which place the processor enters a program or a code fragment and execution begins.
Why main is static?
Ans: Main method is declared as static so that JMV can call the method without instntiating it's class.
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Ans: We can implement non abstract method in an abstract class. But we cannot implement any method in Interface.
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Ans: we cannot make an object from an Interface and abstract class. We can use them by extending abstract class and
implementing Interface to concrete class.
what is Access Specifier?
Ans: Access Specifier regulates the access to classes, constructors, methods and fields.
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
object-Oriented Programming is a programming language model organized around objects and data rather than action
    and ligic. The main feature of OOP are Abstraction, Inheritance, Encaptulation and polymorphism.
    Abstraction: It is hiding data.
     Inheritance: It is the process where one class acquire the properties of another.
     Encaptulaion: It is a machanism of wrapping the data and code together as a single unit.
     Polymorphism: It is the ability of an object to take many forms.
What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Does java support multiple inheritance?
No.
What is method overloading and when it happens?
Ans: When a class has multiple methods of name with different parameters, it is called method overloading. It
happens in compile time.
What is method overriding and when it happens?
Ans: When a method of subclass that already presents in the super class overrides the functionality of the super class
 method, it is called method overriding. It happens in run time
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Ans: Exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program. We can use try catch block to handle exception.
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Ans: In means that the veriable or function is shered with all all instances of the class as static veriables or methodes
belong to the class and we can access them without creating any objects.
What is final and how it has been used in variables and methods?
Ans: Final keyword is used to restric the users. The value of final variable cannot be changed and final method cannot be overriden.
What is final, finally and finalize?
Ans:Final is a key word. Final class cannot be inherited; final method cannot be okverridden and final variable value cannot be changed.
    Finally block that is used to execute important code such as closing connection. It is executed whether exception is handled or not.
    Finallize is used to perform clean up proccessing just before object os garbage collected.
What is a constructor ?
Ans: A consructor is a kind of method but it does not have any return value.The name of the constructor must be the same as the name
 of the class and it is used to initialize an object.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
Ans:It is used inside the method or constructor of class. It works as a reference to the current object whose method or constructor
 is being invoked
What is "super" keyword in java?
Ans: It is used inside a sub class to invoke veriable, method, or constructor of super class.
What is JVM stand for ?
Ans:It stands for Java virtual machine.
What version of java are you using?
We are using verson 1.8.
What is JAR stand for ?
Ans: It stands for Java archive.
What is compile time and run time?
Ans: Source code has to be compiled into machine code in order to be an executable program and it is called complie time.
When the compiled program is run by user and if the program is running, it is called run time.
What is heap?
Ans: It is a run time data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.
How java manage it's memory?
Ans: Java objects stay in an arwa called heap. The heap is created when the JMV starts up and may increase or decrease in
size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbase is automitacally collected by garbage collector.
During garbage collection, objects that are no longer used are cleared, to make space for new objects.
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
