Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans: We need data structure to store data in database retrieve it
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans: Data structure are applied in operating system, management system, numerical analyst, graphics, simulation etc.
what is an Array?
Ans: It is temporary container that holds a fixed nuber of values. Its length cannot be changed once it it created.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: An array satatic in size. Its length cannot be changed once it it created.On the other hand, arrraylist is dynamic in size. Its length
     changes as we insert or remove elements.
what is LinkedList?
Ans: It is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element of a list consists of two items,
 the data and a reference to the next node.
what is queue?
Ans: The java.util.Queue interface is a subtype of java.util.collection interface. It represent an ordered list of object
and provides first in first out services.
what is stack?
Ans: It is a data structure that provide last in first out services.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans: First in first out and last in first out
what is the order of complexity?
     It is a relation between input size and execution time.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Ans: In the best case, the item X is the middle in the array A. A constant number of comparisions (actually just 1)
     are required.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Ans: In the worst case, the item X does not exist in the array at all. Through each recursion or iteration of Binary
     Search, the size of the admissible range is halved. This halving can be done ceiling(lg n ) times.
     Thus, ceiling(lg n )comparisons are required.
what is tree in data structure?
Ans:  A tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) that simulates a
     hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set
     of linked nodes.
what is graph in data structure?
Ans: Graph is a set of items connected by edges. Each item is called a vertex or node. Formally, a graph is a set of vertices
     and a binary relation between vertices, adjacency.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans: a)    HashMap is not synchronized and Hashtable is synchronized.
     b)    HashMap can contain one null key and multiple null values and Hashtable cannot contain any null key or null value.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Ans: The major data structures used in the area are:
     -RDBMS – Array (i.e. Array of structures)
     -Network data model – Graph
     -Hierarchical data model – Trees
How HashMap works in java?
Ans:When we pass Key and Value object to put() method on Java HashMap, HashMap implementation calls hashCode method on
    Key object and applies returned hashcode into its own hashing function to find a bucket location for storing Entry
    object. HashMap in Java stores both key and value .
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Ans:It is thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater
     than or equal to the size of the array.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Ans: There are mainly four different ways to copy all elements of one array into another array in Java.
      Manually,  Arrays.copyOf(), System.arraycopy(), Object.clone()
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans: Array: Array is a collection of elements that have same data type with common name.
     LinkedList:Linked list is an ordered collection of elements which are connected by links/pointers.
What is DFS and BFS?
Ans: The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS) are the two algorithms used for traversing and
     searching a node in a graph. They can also be used to find out whether a node is reachable from a given node or not.
What is Recursion?
Ans: It is a process in which a method calls itself continuously. A method in java that calls itself is
     called recursive method.It makes the code compact but complex to understand.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans: Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O
     specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the
     space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Ans: -QuickSort: Best(O(n log(n)); Average(O(nlog(n));worst(O(N^2)
    -InsertionSort: Best(O(n));Average(O(n^2));worst(O(n^2))

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
